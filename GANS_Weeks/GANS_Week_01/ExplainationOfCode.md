torch.manual_seed(0): Sets the random seed for PyTorch to ensure reproducibility of the results. This is useful for testing purposes, as it ensures that the random elements of the code produce the same output each time it is run pythonguides.com.

The provided code defines a function called show_tensor_images that visualizes images in a grid format. The function takes three arguments: image_tensor, num_images, and size.

image_tensor: A tensor containing the images you want to display.

num_images: The number of images you want to display in the grid (default is 25).

size: The dimensions of each image in the form of a tuple (default is (1, 28, 28)).

Here's a breakdown of the code inside the function:

image_unflat = image_tensor.detach().cpu().view(-1, *size): This line performs three operations on the input tensor:

detach(): Detaches the tensor from the computation graph, so that no gradients are computed projectpro.io. This is useful when you only want to visualize the images and not modify them.

cpu(): Moves the tensor to the CPU if it's on another device like a GPU .

view(-1, *size): Reshapes the tensor to have the specified size, with -1 indicating that the first dimension (batch size) should be inferred automatically .

image_grid = make_grid(image_unflat[:num_images], nrow=5): Calls the make_grid function from torchvision.utils to create a grid of images using the reshaped tensor. The grid contains the first num_images images from the input tensor, and each row of the grid has 5 images tutorialspoint.com.

plt.imshow(image_grid.permute(1, 2, 0).squeeze()): The permute function reorders the dimensions of the image grid tensor to match the format expected by matplotlib.pyplot.
imshow stackoverflow.com. The squeeze function removes any dimensions of size 1 from the tensor . Then, imshow is called to display the image grid.
plt.show(): Displays the image grid plot generated by the previous line.

In summary, the show_tensor_images function takes a tensor of images as input and displays them in a grid format using matplotlib. The images are first detached from the computation graph, moved to the CPU, and reshaped to the specified size. Then, a grid of images is created using the make_grid function, and the grid is displayed using matplotlib.
